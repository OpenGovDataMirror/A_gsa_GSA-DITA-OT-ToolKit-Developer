class     CDATA     "- topic/topic” 

It should be 

class     CDATA     "- topic/topic CoverVolume/CoverVolume “ 

Note also the required trailing space in the @class value. The normal way to match on @class is:

contains(@class, ‘ topic/topic ‘)

Note the trailing space at the end of the string.

If the attribute value default doesn’t also have the space then that type of check will fail.

The D4P code uses a custom function that handles this error but a lot of DITA processing, including the base Open Toolkit processing will not handle that case.
